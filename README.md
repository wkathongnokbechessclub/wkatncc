# West Karbi Anglong Thong Nokbe Chess Club — Dark Theme (updated with logo, event poster and added member photos)

What I changed
- Added the club logo to the header: images/logo.png
- Added a Past Events section with the recent poster: images/event-2025.jpg
- Added two additional member photos into the Members list:
  - images/additional-member-1.jpg
  - images/additional-member-2.jpg
- Kept the existing member and officer image placeholders and the same placeholder-fallback logic. If an image file is present it will show; otherwise the initials SVG is shown.

Files to save in the project folder
- index.html
- css/theme-dark.css
- images/ (create this folder and place the images below)

Image filenames referenced by the template (place the files exactly with these names)
- images/logo.png                (club logo)                     — supplied image #5
- images/event-2025.jpg          (previous event poster)         — supplied image #6
- images/additional-member-1.jpg (additional member photo)       — supplied image #7
- images/additional-member-2.jpg (additional member photo)       — supplied image #8

Existing member/officer image names used previously (optional if you already have them)
- images/welson-engjai.jpg
- images/babu-timung.jpg
- images/khonsi-im-timung.jpg
- images/bapuram-senar.jpg
- images/serlongki-ronghang.jpg
- images/martin-hanse.jpg
- images/boronson-kro.jpg
- images/datson-rongpi.jpg
- images/seniram-ingti.jpg

Notes and tips
- Recommended image format: JPEG or PNG. Square passport-style portraits (e.g., 400x400) work best for member cards.
- The event poster can be larger; the template constrains it for layout.
- If you want specific photos to replace specific names, rename the files to match the filenames listed above (for example replace images/serlongki-ronghang.jpg).
- If you'd like, I can embed images into the HTML as base64 (send the files) or swap member captions to match exact names — upload or provide filenames and I will update the file contents accordingly.

How to view
1. Create a folder, save index.html and the css/theme-dark.css file (in css/), and create images/ with the image files.
2. Open index.html in a browser.
